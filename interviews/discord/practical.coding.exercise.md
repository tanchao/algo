We really enjoyed learning more about you during the call, and we'd like to invite you to the next step of our interview process: a practical coding exercise facilitated by one of our engineers!

We allot 45-60 to the exercise plus 15 minutes for Q&A with facilitator. You can solve it using any language or resources you choose. Please make sure that you have your computer set up to write some code in a comfortable environment.
```

```
Let's do Wed Jan 19, 2022 at 3:30PM (PST)!

You will be connecting with Mack Straight via a Google Meet link which can be found in your calendar invite. You will be sharing your entire screen.

In this exercise, you'll be expected to build a small server-side application. Please have your development environment set up and use a language that you feel comfortable with. This exercise will be a practical, problem-solving question with elements where you may need to look into documentation to learn about new concepts. You'll be allowed to use your browser to research and ask questions of the interviewer. If you're using Windows for your interview, please install PuTTY (https://www.putty.org/) ahead of time.
