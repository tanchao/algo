- kth smallest between different lists
```
Given several pair of low bound and up bound, please find the n-th smallest number among them. Note, the intervals may overlap. For example, 3 intervals, [1, 5], [4, 6], [8, 9], then total number set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9}. If we want to find 5th smallest number, it is 4. 

[1,5] -> max = 5
5 > 4 -> [1,5][4,6]
5<8
[1,5,4,6] -> n
n < max => return n
n > max -> max = 6
6<8
[1,5,4,6] -> n
n <= max (6) => return n
[1,6][8,9]


[1,5] -> max = 5
