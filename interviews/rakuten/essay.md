5 gold rules

* Maximize Customer Satisfaction
* Always Improve, Always Advance
* Passionately Professional

What is success and how to become successful? Different people can give different answers. “Principles for success” presents the ideas from Mr. Hiroshi Mikitani, he believes success can be archived with five simple golden rules, which he already proved with his successful career and life.

“Maximize Customer Satisfaction”, the favorite one I learnt from the treasure, customer is the god. It is obvious that we work, or serve, or create products for someone, someone who needs our products or services. To make their need become want or even desire, which definitely can benefit our business, and bring us closer to our success. Satisfying our clients is one important component of our success.

There was a project to enhance the development environment management and I was part of it. The original idea is to help us, as admins, to manage the environments better. While we stand at our users’ perspective, we realized that they would expect managing the environments by their own to have the flexibility and efficiency. We developed a user-friendly web interface from the old admin scripts; we designed the users and environments authorization control; we provided API to subscribe data from external system because some users want to keep their data centralized there… We listen to our users, and we “Always Improve, Always Advance”, we contributed our passions and professions into every requirements our customer raised, every small need filled every little step we got close to success. It was a small project used by our team only and now expand to global department, I would call it is a success, and it grew at the very beginning – “Can we do better for our users?”

Again, what is success? “Success can mean: feeling that tingle of excitement about what you do, sticking with what matters through hard times, living a life you can feel proud of in retrospect. ” – quoted from TED.
