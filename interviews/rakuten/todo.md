1. Could we have your name and the reason why you are interested in Rakuten?

> Hello Rakuten, my name is Tan Chao, call me Tan or TC as well, nice to meet you.

> Rakuten's business has been doing real good staffs for people, it served and changed people's life style 
significantly; Rakuten has proved its value in Japan, and now is expanding its value worldwide, I can't agree more about
this value and I want to be part of it; About this position, Big-Data platform is a wonderland for every engineer to 
make magic happen, which is also attractive to me; Also, me and my family are willing to explore different cultures, 
Tokyo is definitely one of the most dynamic cities in Asia. With all these matches, I am here for Rakuten.

2. Please tell us your technical background and how you will be able to contribute to the success of the company.
If you already have work experience, please share that as well.

> I graduated from ECUST in 2008, top 20 in China, with a Bachelor degree on Computer Science and Finance Diploma, 2nd 
class. I have been worked as a developer since, proficient programming languages in Java and Python, quite experienced 
in SQL and rational database, stored procedure and some basic db tuning, also I am familiar with front-end technologies, 
such as HTML/CSS/JS etc. I worked in financial and e-commence industry, located in SG/USA/HK for a while, right now as
a Senior Software Engineer for HSBC Guangzhou, responsible for lead a development team for internal framework design
and code also some other business projects. From the job description and company information, I believe my experience 
and skills can help me adopt into the global team/environment very quickly, once I get into the organization, I can add 
value to the team to the firm.

3. What is your greatest strength and how you leverage your strength for peak performance? Please give us an example.

> Confidence! I believe in myself, for my smartness, my intelligence, which make me learn fast and grow fast. When I 
joint HSBC about 4 yrs ago, I had to start with a new programming language - Python and a new working environment - 
UNIX. I had my way to quickly pick up a technical skills, first an official start up tutor, second copy an example 
project and practice, third read a lovely book with details, lastly combine my coding experience with it. I built the 
MESA project from scratch within 3 months and became the Python lead in the team in 1 year. Right now this MESA tiny 
framework is well recognized among the department, used by 3 systems on 3 sites, globally.

4. *This question is for only those who have worked before* Have you ever changed your job? or are you trying to change
your job? Please tell us why.

> Yes, I have been worked for 4 companies, I left the 1st one subjectively as I got the referral from my friend to a 
Singapore position, which I considered a big step for my career and life; the next 2 changes were due to company and 
project reorganization issue. I joint HSBC since 2012, so 4 years till now. The reason why I am trying to find new 
opportunities is I am trying to explore new challenges, right now our project and team are stable, and we don't have 
much chance or freedom to select the tech we want, not even for experiment. Plus HR contact me about this opportunity 
which is sounds like a brand new world, that I definitely want to take the adventure.

5. What are your career goal and career plans? How does this job fit into your career plans?

> I want to be a tech guy till I am 50, 60 years old, I hope I can still stand on the cutting edge technologies. Rakuten
 has the gene to introduce trending new and efficient technologies into company, and willing to use these skills,
 platform and tools to enhance the customer experience the business the value. I want to introduce the robot way to the
 work I will do, automate everything I can to freedom the humanity, this would need wheels from OSS world, I think 
 Big-Data department need wheels like these as it is really big stuffs there.
