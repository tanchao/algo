- [x] Could we have your name and the reason why you are interested in Rakuten?

> Hello Rakuten, my name is Tan Chao, call me Tan or TC as well, nice to meet you.

> Rakuten's business has been doing real good staffs for people, it served and changed people's life style 
significantly; Rakuten has proved its value in Japan, and now is expanding its value worldwide, I can't agree more about
this value and I want to be part of it; About this position, Big-Data platform is a wonderland for every engineer to 
make magic happen, which is also attractive to me; Also, me and my family are willing to explore different cultures, 
Tokyo is definitely one of the most dynamic cities in Asia. With all these matches, I am here for Rakuten.

- [x] Please tell us your technical background and how you will be able to contribute to the success of the company.
If you already have work experience, please share that as well.

> I graduated from ECUST, top 20 in China, in 2008, with a Bachelor degree on Computer Science and Finance Diploma. 
I have been worked as a developer since, proficient programming in Java and Python, skilled in rational database and 
SQL, hands on stored procedure and some basic db tuning, also I am familiar with front-end technologies, 
such as HTML/CSS/JS etc. I worked in finance and e-commence industry in last 7 years, located in SG/USA/HK for a while, 
right now a Senior Software Engineer for HSBC GZ, responsible for leading a dev team for internal platform design
and code and also some other business projects. From the job description and company's information, I believe my 
experience and skills can help me adopt into the global team/environment very quickly, once I get into the organization, 
I can add value to the team to the firm.

- [x] What is your greatest strength and how you leverage your strength for peak performance? Please give us an example.

> Confidence! I believe in myself, for my smartness, my intelligence, which makes me learn faster and start quicker. e.g.
When I joint HSBC about 4 yrs ago, I had to start with a new programming language-Python and a new working environment- 
UNIX. However I managed to build the MESA project from scratch within 3 months. Right now this MESA framework has been 
well recognized among the department, used by 3 systems on 3 sites, globally.I had my way to pick up a technical skills 
quickly, first an official start up tutor, second copy an example project and practice, third read a lovely book with 
details, last not least combine my coding experience with it. In all I have confidence to take responsibilities and 
make it successfully.

- [x] *This question is for only those who have worked before* Have you ever changed your job? or are you trying to change
your job? Please tell us why.

> Yes, I worked for 4 companies, I left the 1st one subjectively as I got the referral from my friend to a 
Singapore position, which I considered a big step for my career and life; the next 2 changes were due to company and 
project reorganization issue. I joint HSBC since 2012, after 4 years engagement and enhancement, our project and team 
are much more stable now, daily life become easy and a bit boring. Weeks ago HR contacted me about this position and 
introduced me the exciting team and challenges. So the reason why I am here is because I am trying to explore big 
challenges and new life style, to take the adventure for true value.  

- [x] What are your career goal and career plans? How does this job fit into your career plans?

> I want to be a tech guy till I am old enough, I hope I can still lead a team with cutting edge technologies and 
create cool things. I also want to bring the robot mind into the work, automate boring stuffs to let people focus on 
interesting tasks. I think Rakuten has the gene to introduce technology into the business value, thus they value 
technology the same way. I believe the Big-Data department need effective ideas and tools to handle the difficult 
problems, and automation as problems are too big to handle manually. With these understandings and expectation, it is 
reasonable to start a new journey with Rakuten. And I sincerely wish I can grow with the team, create BIG value with 
the company.
