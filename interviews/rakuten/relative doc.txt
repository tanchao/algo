first round is the video interview. There are 5 question,
a. what's your name,
why Rakuten ?
b, what your technical background,
c what's your greatest strength?
d what's your career goal?
and there is program test, if you apply for engineer, if you apply for researcher, there is two program test.
You can search the program on the internet.


But the java part was tricky as there were lot of boundary conditions <codility style>

Strength and weakness and where do you want to see yourself after 5 years?


Codility interview question: (easy) find the standard deviation of an array.
Skype interview: questions about previous projects I have done


Coding test: given 2 rectangles described by their top-right and bottom-left coordinates,
return the top-right and bottom-left coordinates of the intersection. Time limit is 1 hour.


* Codility: Find the sum of the area of two possible overlapping rectangles.
* Pre-recorded video questions: They will be given to you in advance, so you will be able to prepare.
But basically, why rakuten, what can you bring to rakuten, your work and skills, etc. pretty standard stuff.

After applying through a careers website, I was asked to complete a coding test and a prerecorded video interview.
The coding test was pretty easy; I had an hour to solve a given problem and test it.
It was unsupervised. The prerecorded video interview was really easy since they gave me the questions ahead of time
- why are you interested in the company,
- what's your greatest strength, etc.
Once I passed that step, they invited me to a Skype interview. I was told it was with engineers,
so I assumed they would ask me to code or at least come up with a way to solve a problem, but they were more general
knowledge questions
- 'tell me about this thing on your resume',
- 'have you ever done unit testing?', etc.
Also things like 'tell us about a book you've read recently on a technical topic', which I was not at all prepared for.
Also, there were three interviewers crowded around one screen, one of whom had a face mask on and none of whom
I could understand clearly. It was not great, and I knew by the end I hadn't passed.


The whole process is strictly time consuming. It takes almost 3 months. I applied for the new grad position
(software engineer) on their official recruitment website. First you need to register an account and upload your
resume to their recruitment website. One or more weeks later, you will receive their email to let you take the
online programming test and pre-recored video interview. The programming test seems keep unchanged for many years.
The questions of the pre-recored video interview has been written in the email. If you pass the first round screening,
you will receive an email to let you take the second interview from their HR after one or two weeks. The interviewer is
one of their engineers. No difficult technical problems. Most are the questions about your past experiences and behavior
questions. After that, you will be required to take third interview. The interview can be conducted via Skype.
The interviewer is also an engineer with higher position. Behavior questions. Final interview seems like a company
culture introduction. No more questions. I am still waiting for the final result.
