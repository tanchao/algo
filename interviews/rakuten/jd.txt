==============================================
Hi Tan,

As far as know, Big-data department is mostly non-Japanese and Japanese language is not required. That's why, they
actively hired top talents from out of Japan.
It is clear that you cannot speak Japanese language, so I don't think they will assign you for Japan market and any
teams requiring Japanese language. I have several candidates from out of Japan without Japanese language joined in
Rakuten but they don't use Japanese for work so far.

Regarding English test, TOEIC is the most famous English certificate in Japan.
TOEIC is used to measure English for daily life and business work while TOEFL is for academic study and needed to enter
an university in English speaking countries.

I believe you did College English Test (CET) in China.
Do you have the score of CET-6? I believe your English is at high, at least above TOEIC 800 which is required by
Rakuten. I think TOEIC 800 is for slightly limited business level. As far as my Taiwanese candidate who joined in
Big-data department as Data Sicentist/software development engineer, he did not to have TOEIC score and also CET score
though he could speak English smoothly (not at fluent but good enough to talk without interruption). Rakuten did not
require him to take their own English test like TOEIC.

If you are all right, I will proceed the application.
I need to register your resume, name and email address into their system.

Their hiring process is relatively slow.
1. Resume screening is in approximately 2 weeks
2. Answer to recorded video questions about your profile, skills and interest, online coding test
3. 3-4 time Skype interview (1 weeks to get the result every interview)
4. After signing get on the offer letter, they will star the visa application and takes 1-1.5 month to be approved
officially and then you should join in the company immediately.

Best regards,
Taka
