==============================================
Hi Tan,

As far as know, Big-data department is mostly non-Japanese and Japanese language is not required. That's why, they
actively hired top talents from out of Japan.
It is clear that you cannot speak Japanese language, so I don't think they will assign you for Japan market and any
teams requiring Japanese language. I have several candidates from out of Japan without Japanese language joined in
Rakuten but they don't use Japanese for work so far.

Regarding English test, TOEIC is the most famous English certificate in Japan.
TOEIC is used to measure English for daily life and business work while TOEFL is for academic study and needed to enter
an university in English speaking countries.

I believe you did College English Test (CET) in China.
Do you have the score of CET-6? I believe your English is at high, at least above TOEIC 800 which is required by
Rakuten. I think TOEIC 800 is for slightly limited business level. As far as my Taiwanese candidate who joined in
Big-data department as Data Sicentist/software development engineer, he did not to have TOEIC score and also CET score
though he could speak English smoothly (not at fluent but good enough to talk without interruption). Rakuten did not
require him to take their own English test like TOEIC.

If you are all right, I will proceed the application.
I need to register your resume, name and email address into their system.

Their hiring process is relatively slow.
1. Resume screening is in approximately 2 weeks
2. Answer to recorded video questions about your profile, skills and interest, online coding test
3. 3-4 time Skype interview (1 weeks to get the result every interview)
4. After signing get on the offer letter, they will star the visa application and takes 1-1.5 month to be approved
officially and then you should join in the company immediately.

Best regards,
Taka

==============================================
Note:
Rakuten sent you the requirement of submitting in a separate email.
Please forward the email to me, so that I can guide you how to deal with it.

I assume that the email is about the essay of books their founder wrote.
I doubt there is English version of the books, so please refer to the link below and comment anything.

This essay is nothing related to hiring decision but it must finish it somehow.
(I guess they would like to share their corporate culture with a candidate by the books)

Ref: Five Principles for Success
http://global.rakuten.com/corp/about/philosophy/success.html
Ex) Pick up ‘maximize customer satisfaction’ to explain your idea and successful story.

The deadline to submit is by 23:59 on 21 Feb in Japan time.
They will not arrange the final interview until you submit it.

Best regards,

==============================================
Hi Tan,

Other companies sometimes use a essay as a behavioral review seriously, while Rakuten uses essay casually to share their
behavioral principles with a candidate.

For example, one client asks "please write a case to show 'customer-centric''. You must describe your decision making;
the background, options you considers, and how you measure the result as well as what is intangible result."

In this case, you should define who is your customer, what their pains are, how you identify the pains,  how you improve
their satisfaction, what obstacles and conflicts were, how you deal with them, what the result was, how to measure the
result, what the intangible result was, why you can achieve it, what you learned from the experience, whether you can
implement the same story in other cases and etc.

For a behavioral interview, the storytelling above is expected either in writing or verbally.

Best regards,
Taka
